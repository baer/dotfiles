# Creating a custom Prompt

The prompt is built with bash-it

You can create your own by customizing any of the themes from the bash-it repo.
Don't forget to import the base theme and colors at the top

```bash
source "$DOTFILES/shell/prompt/colors.theme.bash"
source "$DOTFILES/shell/prompt/base.theme.bash"
```
